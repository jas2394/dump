<p class="noindent">Much has changed in the decade between this and the last edition of this book, but one thing has stayed the same: getting a book this size out the door takes a whole lot of help and patience from a large number of people. I’ll thank a few of them here and hope that the rest understand that I am grateful for all of the help and latitude they have given me over the course of this long project.</p>
<p class="indent">First off, my wonderful wife, Sylvia, and my children, Graham, Olivia, and Desmond, always gave me reasons why I should leave the world of JavaScript and take a break. My long-time collaborator, Christie Sorenson, helped in too many ways to enumerate here, so much so that she was even pulled in to do the technical edit of the book. Rob McFarlane helped by creating line art manuscript again and will sadly cringe seeing new clip art thrown over his work by the production department. Sorry, Rob—they have their rules! I won’t name all of the people at my company and beyond with whom I interacted and who influenced me or helped me shape the JavaScript content in the book, but a few warrant a shout-out, including Mike “silkjs” Schwartz, Tom “the Man” Maneri, D. Sargent, Joe Lima, Adrian Zaharia, and Allan Pister. Kyle Simpson also should be mentioned for his helpful and diligent assistance in some of the chapter materials on object and performance.</p>
<p class="indent">I should give special thanks to the folks at McGraw-Hill for helping this book make its long, slow journey to paper. Megg Morin, in particular, whom I have worked with for approaching a decade now, probably wanted to quote the actor Danny Glover’s most famous line on a daily basis while dealing with this book. I believe, in fact, that in the distant future, “Having the patience of Megg” may become a common phrase. I also must not forget LeeAnn Pickrell, Stephanie Evans, Janet Walden, Joya Anthony, and, I am sure, many others who kept this process going.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of reviewers deserve mention, most importantly, Daisy Bhonsle, who for some reason likes catching typos. Rigie Chang, Bill Berry, and Michael Jay deserve a quick shout-out, too, for helping on a few chapters before the big crunch.</p>
<p class="indent">Last, but certainly not least, I must thank all of my students from both UCSD CSE and UCSD Extension who helped shaped the material. I also should acknowledge the various interactions I have had with readers and students around the world. All of the questions and insights you have brought have gone into this edition, and I look forward to many new thoughts from all of you in the future.</p>
